# Why Me

I believe there's three things I can bring for sweetgreen,

* A wide breath of prior experience in programming, statistics, manufacturing, and supply chain
* A willingness to continue learning at a rapid rate
* A strong desire to grow with a great team

I regularly strive to expand my knowledge and techincal ability,
and share that understanding with others. A relevant example
is this blog post written on 
[optimizing supply chains with Bayesian Statistics](http://canyon289.github.io/BayesianDecisionMaking.html#bayesian-decision-making-in-supply-chain)

I found that by working with others we're all able to improve more than
we could have alone. Below are other examples of outreach in the
community that is particularly technically focused.

## Community Outreach
* I run ArviZ’s twitter account https://twitter.com/arviz_devs
* Correspond with NumFOCUS frequently on open source topics such as funding, diversity etc
* Google Summer of Code Mentor for ArviZ and PyMC (pending acceptance)
    * https://github.com/arviz-devs/arviz/wiki/GSoC-2019-projects
    * https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/wiki/GSoC-2019-projects
* Engage with developers on Arviz Gitter https://gitter.im/arviz-devs/community

## Developer Meetings
* Attended Google London PyMC Developer meeting https://twitter.com/pymc_devs/status/1076153774027259906
