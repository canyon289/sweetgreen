# Why sweetgreen

Although seemingly straightforward there are multiple answers to this
question

## Rethinking the food supply chain
For years I have been interested in supply chains, and in my experience
I usually run into two types

### *Local* supply chains
A small shop, whether restaurant or manufacturing business, obtains
supplies from people around the area. This is great because materials
do not have to travel far, and the surrounding community is tight knit
shares success.  This is how people lived for the majority of
our existence.

However most implementations of this model do not scale well
due to the high overhead cost of managing each individual supply chain,
and lack of economies of scale. These supply chains are also suspectible
to failure as their geographical risk is high.
Due some these issues

### Scalable homogeneous supply chain
Think McDonald's, the globalization Cavendish bananas or iPhones.
Due to the wonders of modern supply chains it's now possible to
ship an identical product anywhere across the world. As a bonus 
the homogeneity allows for large levels of cost reduction and optimization.

Despite the benefits as a downside though we are harming the
environment and

### A scalable local supply chain
Sweetgreen is a rare company that seems to be working through the
challenges of creating efficient local supply chains, particularly
by using a combination of boots on the (literal) ground farming,
combined with modern computational methods. This is incredibly 
unique and a fresh take on paradigms from the past.

## Working with a great team
At this point I've talked to multiple people associated with sweetgreen,
both office staff and restaurant and the responses have been positive.

From a skills standpoint the team looks stellar, with prior experience
in areas such as a biology or computer science

## The technical challenge
Apply statistics to supply chain is exactly what I'd like to be doing
full time. The subheading for *live the sweetlife* is "celebrate
your passion and purpose* and I feel like I'd get that opportunity
at sweetgreen

## Helping people stay healthy
Obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable death. Sweetgreen
seems to be dedicated to providing delicious but healthy meals and I 
feel like this can only help people live longer better lives.
